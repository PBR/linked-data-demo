# linked-data-demo
An example web app to demonstrate the use of FAIR data and FAIR data point.

This demonstrator has been adjusted to the plant science use case. It is still very rough, and many things are hardcoded. Also, the ontology terms used for the tomato dataset are largely placeholders.

The ttl files in the datasets folder need to be available for querying, as specified by the path in the [config.js](https://github.com/PBR/linked-data-demo/blob/master/js/config.js#L1) file.
